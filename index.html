      The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficent than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

  <img src="attendance.jpg" class="lmg-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy, 
    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inveitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate peformanceand payroll data.
    <br>
    2. Economics,
    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by puttting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching absenteesim, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. Asa matter of fact, a study done by the Aesium Group found that large organizations save up to 1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.</p>
    <br>
    3. Productivity / Efficency,
    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time consuming, labourious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authourize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
